            Cardamom Auction.com – an online trading platform developed by Mr.
            Jeff Thomas in the year 2011 for the cardamom quality analysis and
            thereby to upgrade the then existing auction system to pure online
            auction. It was known as “Cardamom Marketing Information System”.
            The entire system is designed in a simple matrix (rows and column)
            format, so that it can be easily understood by everyone. Even with a
            persistent 9 years of effort didn’t bear fruit, and the system was
            not implemented in the cardamom trade till 2020. During the
            corvid-19 pandemic, when the entire cardamom trade was frozen to its
            core, Mr. Jeff Thomas; implemented the system in its new avatar as
            Cardamom Auction. Com and brought life back to the cardamom trade.
            Afterwards the entire history of cardamom trade has shifted to a new
            era. Even the spices board e-auction system was rearranged and
            redesigned due to the changes brought by him into the industry.
